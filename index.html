        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m passionate about theoretical reinforcement learning and network optimization. I am currently looking for a PhD position in reinforcement learning, decision making, or network optimization. If there are any opportunities, please contact me at <a href="mailto:govindrao.sri@gmail.com">govindrao.sri@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an MS student in statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have completed coursework in mathematical statistics, statistical learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
        <p>My research focuses on studying RL environments with non-stationary dynamics. I am also interested in exploring the intersection of networks and RL to improve sample efficiency in RL algorithms.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I have experience as a teaching assistant for the course "Computing in Astronomy." During the summer, I worked as a research assistant at RailTEC at Illinois, where I developed statistical tools to detect railroad maintenance. We are currently preparing a draft for a paper based on my summer research.</p>
