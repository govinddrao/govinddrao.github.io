        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
I am an MS student in statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I have completed coursework in mathematical statistics, statistical learning and reinforcement learning.
            I am mainly interested in studying RL environments which have non stationary dynamics. The other area I am interested in is at the intersection of networks and RL. I want to understand
            if we can improve RL algorithms using networks, particulary in the aspect of sample efficiency. I also have teaching experience as a TA for "Computing in Astronomy". In the summer,
            I worked as an RA at RailTEC at Illinois, where I worked on developing statistical tools to detect railroad maintenance. We are currently preparing a draft for a paper on my summer research.
